# Contact Form Solution

Your contact form now uses FormSubmit.co, which is a free email service that doesn't require any API keys or complex setup.

## How It Works

1. When a user submits the form, the data is sent to FormSubmit.co's servers
2. FormSubmit then forwards the submission to your email address (dulanganikeshala2@gmail.com)
3. The first time someone submits the form, you'll receive an activation email from FormSubmit
4. After activating (by clicking the link in that email), all future submissions will be delivered directly

## Important Notes

1. **First Submission**: The first form submission will not be delivered. Instead, you'll get an activation email from FormSubmit. This is a one-time verification process.

2. **Customization Options**: The current implementation includes:
   - Redirect back to your site after submission (`_next` parameter)
   - Custom subject line (`_subject` parameter)
   - Disabled CAPTCHA (`_captcha=false` parameter)

3. **Production Deployment**: When you deploy your site, update the `_next` parameter with your actual domain:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://your-actual-domain.com" />
   ```

4. **Switching to EmailJS Later**: If you want to switch to EmailJS in the future (for more features like templates, attachments, etc.), you can:
   1. Set up your EmailJS account
   2. Update your `.env` file with your credentials
   3. Revert to the previous EmailJS code
