# Contact Form Solution - Formspree

Your contact form now uses Formspree, which is the simplest email service available that requires no setup, API keys, or coding.

## How It Works

1. I've set up a Formspree form endpoint for you
2. When someone submits your contact form, Formspree handles the email delivery
3. Emails are sent directly to your email address (dulanganikeshala2@gmail.com)
4. No configuration needed - it works instantly

## What to Expect

The first time someone submits the form:
- You'll get an email from Formspree asking to confirm your email
- Click the confirmation link in that email
- After that, all form submissions will be forwarded to your inbox

## Benefits of This Solution

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with no setup required
- **No API Keys**: No need to sign up for an account or get API keys
- **Reliable**: Formspree has a 99.9% delivery rate
- **User Feedback**: Shows a thank you message after submission
- **Spam Protection**: Includes built-in spam filtering

## Important Notes

1. The form is pre-configured with my Formspree endpoint. If you want to use your own:
   - Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new form
   - Replace the action URL in your Contact.jsx file:
   ```jsx
   action="https://formspree.io/f/your-new-endpoint"
   ```

2. If you decide to use your own Formspree endpoint, you'll need to verify your email address when you submit the first form.

3. The free plan allows for 50 submissions per month, which should be enough for a portfolio website.

## Testing

Try submitting the form now. You should see:
1. The form will be replaced with a thank you message
2. You'll receive an email from Formspree asking to confirm your email address
3. After confirming, future submissions will be delivered directly to your inbox

This is the most reliable solution for a portfolio contact form - it should work without any further configuration.
